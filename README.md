# Coursework_1_web_Dev
My Coursework for web development in designing a website using react for the frontend and for the backend using express and nedb 

Summary of the coursework is to create, to design and implement a responsive, single-page application to allow conference attendees to plan their event as the goal of this application is to allow users to search for presenters, view information about talks; check times and sessions; create a personal itinerary; store and review their itinerary and record their priorities about which talks to attend. 

Description of the features of the website 

- Search bar on the home page that allow the user the search for the talks by speaker and title  

- browse talks by session such as session a, b, c

-	it allows the user to mark talks as of potential interest by clicking on the icon and the icon colour is red its mark is an interest but when unclick shows the icon is blue and show all the talks

-	it allows the user to rate talks by click on the star icons the rating the talks between the numbers one to 5 and view the average rating for each talk from all users and filter out the minimal rating scores for the user which allow users to only view the best rated

-	create tags filter system the allow the user to select talks that they will be interested in by selecting the tags on the page 

-	create a register page of the users to login themselves is login user on the website 

-	create a login page allows the user to access the own account within the page website 

-	a log in user a view an individualised schedule of personal itinerary talks they wish to attend, at that the talk should not include more than one talk at any given time 

-	a log in user can create their own comments and view comments from other log in users  
 

Instruction on how to run the application 

-	Download folder called Coursework_1_web_dev_project of my project 

-	Note that if you down from my git hub link only shows the frontend files for the project 

-	Open the project with a visual studio code then open the project folder then follow these instructions on to the new terminal 

-	First command is cd .\Coursework_1_web_Dev\ then do the ls command you should see one file called README.md two folders one of the is called frontend_react this is the folder for the frontend development of the website using react and the next folder is called backend which is the API for the backend of the website using node.js 

-	Next command is to enter the backend folder using cd .\backend\ on the Terminal then node index to run the backend of the application 

-	Then on open put a tab on chrome and type in localhost:3001 to make sure the API information is running correctly

-	Next point to go back to visual studio open new terminal and follow the first command then unlike the second command we what to run the frontend of the web application so enter in the command cd .\frontend_react\     then in order to run the react for the frontend of the website must enter in this command npm start

-	Then in order to make sure that the website is up and running open new browsers tab the type into the search bar localhost:3000 and now that is application running on local machine
