# Coursework_1_web_Dev
My Coursework for web development in designing a website using react for the frontend and for the backend using express and nedb 

Summary of the coursework is to create, to design and implement a responsive, single-page application to allow conference attendees to plan their event as the goal of this application is to allow users to search for presenters, view information about talks; check times and sessions; create a personal itinerary; store and review their itinerary and record their priorities about which talks to attend. 
the website will consist of a number of sessions, each of which will contain a number of individual talks, each talk is given by a single speaker. There may be more than one session running in parallel at any given time. A talk may have a number of tags associated with it to indicate its content.

what the application can do 

-	search talks by speaker 
-	browse talks by session 
-	mark talks as of potential interest 
-	view an individualised schedule of talks they wish to attend, which should not include more than one talk at any given time 
-	rate talks and view the average rating for each talk from all users
